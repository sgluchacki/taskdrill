# TaskDrill

Maybe it's just me, but the way I tend to organize my todo list is a bit hierarchical; I tend to 'bucket' things that I need to do. For example, at some point I'm interested in learning a few new programming languages. Let's talk about learning the Go language. Go belongs in a list of 'New Languages'. Parallel to that list might be things like 'Known Languages', 'Packages and Libraries', 'Security', etc. These all live inside of 'Programming', which is inside of 'Computers'. Further, when I start to learn Go I'll have a list of things to do to learn it, and if necessary I might break down those steps even further.

Some tasks require drilling pretty deep in order to get them done correctly. Imagine starting a new business. It might be something as simple as 'building widgets'. But in order to launch a lot of different things need to be accomplished in a lot of different areas. This is where TaskDrill is best for you!

## How Does It Work?

PUT STUFF HERE AFTER THE DESIGN PHASE

## Technologies:

This is a MERN-stack application, here's a fairly comprehensive breakdown of the technologies used:
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- ExpressJS
- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- Token-based authentication
- AJAX
- [Trello](https://trello.com/b/H42E5cE7/taskdrill)

## Next Steps:

A lot more can be done here and I plan to get it done. Maybe I'll just the App to help with the process:
- 'Task Templates': There are a lot of tasks that require using the same steps. Wouldn't it be nice to have every step required to start a MERN app at your disposal in your projects list?
- Due Date functionality
- Notifications
- Read-only sample material for new users to tour
- Initialize new users with seeded task trees
- Animations are cool
- Collaboration: share sub tasks and work with other users on them
- Public boards and the ability to make subtrees public or private
- Task priorities
